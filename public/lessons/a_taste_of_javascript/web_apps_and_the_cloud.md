# Web Applications

A web application ("web app") is a program that is split into two parts:

1. the *server side*, aka the "back end", whose job it is to "talk" with a web browser across the internet, as well as other services like databases
2. the *client side*, aka the "front end", which runs *inside* each user's web browser

# The Cloud

* web developers write and test code on their own computers...
* ...then they *deploy* the same code to a different computer
  * "deploy" means "upload" or "transfer" or "push"
* "in the cloud" means "running on someone else's computer"
  * AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Heroku, etc.
  * it's like renting a safety deposit box in a huge vault

# Using Git to Deploy to the Cloud
